# Legacy-free Locale Service

Plan:
1. take the systemd APIs as a sensible starting point.
2. deviate only where we add value

### Language and Keyboard

#### Systemd

The systemd API for Locale(Language) and Keyboard is this:
(where the last boolean means Interactive, and the other boolean means Convert)

```
org.freedesktop.locale1 service
/org/freedesktop/locale1 object
NAME                    TYPE      SIG   RESULT/VALUE
org.freedesktop.locale1 interface -     -
.SetLocale              method    asb   -
.SetVConsoleKeyboard    method    ssbb  -
.SetX11Keyboard         method    ssssbb-
(all properties are read-only and emit PropertiesChanged)
.Locale                 property  as    1 "LANG=en_US.UTF-8"
.VConsoleKeymap         property  s     "cz-lat2-us"
.VConsoleKeymapToggle   property  s     ""
.X11Layout              property  s     "cz,us"
.X11Model               property  s     "pc105"
.X11Options             property  s     "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,grp:shift_toggâ€¦
.X11Variant             property  s     "qwerty,basic"
```

#### Design of Elementary Layer (lower)

- Just use the systemd API, don't add any API of our own

#### Design of Proposal Layer (upper)

- when setting the locale, adjust the proposed package selection and keyboard
  accordingly. And timezone.



The general design of the proposal layer is

- declarative, using read-write properties
- setting some properties will make changes in the proposal layer of other
  properties of other objects

So here, setting `Locale` below will set also `X11Keyboard` here and
  - Agama...Software...todo(...)
  - Agama...Timezone...todo(...)

For the first version of the API, let's keep things simple:

**LocaleType** is just one string, the value for the `LANG` variable, like
`"cs_CZ.UTF-8"`.

**X11KeyboardType** is a pair of strings, the Layout and Variant, for example
`("cz", "qwerty")` or `("us", "basic")`.

We don't expose the console keyboard, instead letting systemd do it via the
_convert_ parameter.

(The other systemd keyboard settings are X11Model and X11Options, we don't
have UI or data for that)

```
# this is gdbus syntax BTW
node ...Agama/Locale1 {
  interface ...Agama.Locale1 {
    methods:
      # FIXME: the method part is unclear to me. anyone better at proposals?
      Commit();
    properties:
      # NOTE: "as" has different meaning to systemd,
      # we have a list of LANG settings, 1st gets passed to systemd,
      # others affect package selection
      readwrite as   Locale = ['cs_CZ.UTF-8', 'de_DE.UTF-8'];
      readwrite (ss) X11Keyboard = ('cz','qwerty);
  };
};
```

##### Overriding the User's Choice?

<details>
<summary>
If setting the Locale proposes the Language, what do we do if the user first
changes the language and _then_ the locale?
</summary>

When Agama UI first shows up, it may show default choices like:

>  Locale: English (US), Keyboard: US

Then we change the locale to Czech, and the keyboard is adjusted automatically:

>  Locale: Czech, Keyboard: Czech

We tune the keyboard:

>  Locale: Czech, Keyboard: Czech (qwerty)

When we then change the locale, the keyboard could stay the same, as we have
already touched it:

>  Locale: German, Keyboard: Czech (qwerty)
</details>

##### Simple Design: Always Repropose

We can easily afford throwing away the user's choice of keyboard layout and
simply set what we consider a good default for a newly set locale, because:

1. it is just one setting (as opposed to whole partitioning layout)
2. the change will be visible in the UI, I assume

##### Detailed Design: Prioritize

But other cases may not be as simple, so here's a generic design:

All settings are wrapped in a `Priority<T>` generic type (an Enum in Rust),
meaning, what is the source and importance of the setting:
- `Machine(data)` means the system has proposed it
- `Human(data)` means the user has made the choice

In D-Bus, it is represented by wrapping the data in a struct, with a leading
byte* tagging the priority. For ease of recognition when watching bus traffic,
special numbers are used:
- `23` means Human, for the number of chromosome pairs
- `42` means Machine, as the famous Answer was given by Deep Thought, a machine

In the following dump, we see that the locale was set by the user and the
system has adjusted the keyboard.

```
node ...Agama/Locale1 {
  interface ...Agama.Locale1 {
    properties:
      readwrite (yas)   Locale = (23, ['cs_CZ.UTF-8', 'de_DE.UTF-8']);
      readwrite (y(ss)) X11Keyboard = (42, ('cz','qwerty));
  };
};
```

You may know a [similar settings in libzypp][resstatus] where it has 4 levels.

*: maybe this is a crazy optimization? I am not too opposed to use strings for
this on the bus.

### Timezone

#### Systemd

```
$ busctl --system introspect org.freedesktop.timedate1 /org/freedesktop/timedate1
NAME                      TYPE      SIG  RESULT/VALUE     FLAGS
...
org.freedesktop.timedate1 interface -    -                -
.ListTimezones            method    -    as               -
.SetLocalRTC              method    bbb  -                -
.SetNTP                   method    bb   -                -
.SetTime                  method    xbb  -                -
.SetTimezone              method    sb   -                -
(properties are read only)
.CanNTP                   property  b    true             -
.LocalRTC                 property  b    false            emits-change
.NTP                      property  b    false            emits-change
.NTPSynchronized          property  b    false            -
.RTCTimeUSec              property  t    1681214874000000 -
.TimeUSec                 property  t    1681214874046139 -
.Timezone                 property  s    "Europe/Prague"  emits-change
```

"LocalRTC" means "is the local time zone used for the real time clock",
so it's !hwclock_in_UTC

#### Design of Elementary Layer (lower)

Just use the systemd API, don't add any API of our own. We will use
- .ListTimezones
- .SetLocalRTC
- .SetTimezone
- .LocalRTC
- .Timezone

#### Design of Proposal Layer (upper)

None needed?
