Internationalization (sometimes abbreviated as "i18n") is a process for
supporting different languages and locales in software. This documentation
describes how is that handled in Agama.

Each Agama part (the web frontend, the D-Bus backend and the command line
interface) needs to solve this problem separately, see more details for each
part in the details below.

## Translations

For translation process Agama uses [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) tool running
at the [openSUSE](https://l10n.opensuse.org/) instance.

## The Workflow

The basic translation workflow looks like this:

1. The translatable texts are marked for translation in the source code, usually
   with the `_()` function or something similar
2. The translatable string are collected into a POT file which is uploaded to
   the staging [agama-weblate](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama-weblate) GitHub
   repository
3. The POT file is loaded by the Weblate into the
   [agama](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) project
4. Translators then can translate the English texts into other languages
5. Weblate pushes back the translations in the PO files back to the
   [agama-weblate](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama-weblate) repository
6. The translations in the PO files are regularly copied to the main repository
   using pull requests
7. The PO files are processed during build so the translations can be used
   later at runtime

*Note: The Agama workflow is pretty similar to the [Cockpit localization](
https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/doc/i18n.md) workflow,
we decided to use a similar approach here.*

## Staging Translation Repository

The special [agama-weblate](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama-weblate)
repository works like a buffer between the Agama sources and the Weblate tool.

We do not want to spam the Weblate tool with every trivial change in the texts
and the other way round, we do not need to get dozen commits from the Weblate
every day with updated translations. This would be especially annoying
before releasing a new version where we might want to accept only unnecessary
changes to not break something at the very last minute.

The agama-weblate repository uses webhooks to notify the Weblate instance
of any change. Changes in the repository should be visible in Weblate in matter
of seconds.

## Synchronization

The content between the main [agama](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama) and
the translation [agama-weblate](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama-weblate)
GitHub repositories is synchronized automatically using the GitHub Actions.

### Uploading Translatable Texts

Collecting and uploading the translatable texts is done by the
[weblate-update-pot.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/.github/workflows/weblate-update-pot.yml)
GitHub action.

- It checks out both `agama` and `agama-weblate` repositories
- It runs a script which extracts the translatable strings in the `agama`
  repository into a POT file
- The POT file is copied to the `agama-weblate` repository and committed to
  the GitHub repository

This action is run daily, but it can be started manually if needed.
Go to the [weblate-update-pot.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/actions/workflows/weblate-update-pot.yml)
action detail and use the "Run workflow" option at the top of the page.

The code compares the old POT file with the new one and if there is no change
besides the timestamps in the file it is not uploaded to `agama-weblate`.

### Downloading Updated Translations

The translations from the `agama-weblate` repository are merged back by the
[weblate-merge-po.yml](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/.github/workflows/weblate-merge-po.yml)
GitHub action.

- It checks out both `agama` and `agama-weblate` repositories
- It copies the PO files from the `agama-weblate` to the `agama` repository
- It creates a pull request with the changes

If there are no changes besides the timestamps in the PO files the pull request
is not created.

## Weblate Configuration

The [Agama Weblate](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) project defines a
separate translation component for each Agama part (the web frontend, the D-Bus
backend and the command line interface).

For reading the translations it uses the [agama-weblate](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama-weblate) GitHub repository, but for the source
code locations it uses the original [agama](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama)
repository. That means after clicking the source location link in the Weblate
you will see the correct source location in the other repository.

### Plugins

The Weblate components use the [msgmerge](
https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-4.9.1/admin/addons.html#addon-weblate-gettext-msgmerge)
plugin which automatically updates all PO files to match the POT file. That
means after adding or updating any translatable text the changes are
automatically applied to all existing PO files and translators can translate
the new or updated texts immediately.
