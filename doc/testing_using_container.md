## Testing Using Container

To test complex change that affects multiple parts of agama it is possible to
run from sources using container that is used to run CI.

Below is shell script that start container, provides web UI on port 9090 and
also gives root access to container for more testing.

```sh
# https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head:Containers/agama-testing
CIMAGE=registry.opensuse.org/yast/head/containers/containers_tumbleweed/opensuse/agama-testing:latest
# rename this if you test multiple things
CNAME=agama
# the '?' here will report a shell error
# if you accidentally paste a command without setting the variable first
echo ${CNAME?}

test -f service/agama.gemspec || echo "You should run this from a checkout of agama"

# destroy the previous instance, can fail if there is no previous instance
podman stop ${CNAME?}
podman rm ${CNAME?}

# Update our image
podman pull ${CIMAGE?}

podman run --name ${CNAME?} \
  --privileged --detach --ipc=host \
  -v .:/checkout \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  ${CIMAGE?}

# shortcut for the following
CEXEC="podman exec ${CNAME?} bash -c"

${CEXEC?} "cd /checkout && ./setup.sh"

# Now the CLI is in the same repo, just symlink it
${CEXEC?} "ln -sfv /checkout/./rust/target/debug/agama /usr/bin/agama"

# Manually start cockpit as socket activation does not work with port forwarding
${CEXEC?} "systemctl start cockpit"

# Optional: Interactive shell in the container
podman exec --tty --interactive ${CNAME?} bash

```
